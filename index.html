<h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
<p>I have tried to do the project and couldn't make the webpage by my own. It was not falling at the same page. Up until this morning I have created few pages for this project but it was not right.
that's why I decided to follow with teachers format. I tried to tweek as much as I could. but couldnt change. That's why I am submitting like as it is. I am doing this just to have a project up better than nothing. I failed this class last semester I think I might fail agian. but I tried harder than last time.</p>

<p> I have shown this prjoct "Space X Dragon" to my sister she said a little more animation would be awesome, but I have no time to do because deadline is very close.</p>
